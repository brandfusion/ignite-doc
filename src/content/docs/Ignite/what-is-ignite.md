Ignite bridges the gap between the default [Dynamicweb]((https://dynamicweb.com/)) frontend framework ([Swift2](https://doc.dynamicweb.dev/swift/getting-started/index.html)) and a production-ready implementation. It allows you to build website UIs faster and more efficiently with minimal configuration, leveraging modern browser features, UI/UX best practices, and proven e-commerce content patterns to deliver best-in-class elements.

# Main Modules

1. Content
2. Ecommerce

## Content Features

Content features are pre-configured pairs of [Item Types](https://doc.dynamicweb.dev/manual/dynamicweb10/settings/areas/content/itemtypes.html?q=item%20types) and Templates that empower content managers. With minimal settings and intuitive options, they can quickly generate beautiful UI elements that effectively showcase the brand strategy and business goals on the e-commerce platform. These features are highly extensible, allowing you to easily customize or add new UI elements while keeping the focus on your products and business needs.
