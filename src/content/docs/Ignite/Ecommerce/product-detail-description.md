The Product Detail Description component is designed to display detailed information about a product on its dedicated page. This element is essential for providing customers with comprehensive insights into the product's features, specifications, and benefits.

## Features
- Gets its content from a page with a name that contains the product's number: `PN-[ProductNumber]`

## Development Notes
- The component fetches and displays content dynamically based on the product being viewed, ensuring that each product page has relevant and specific information.
- Make sure to create and assign the appropriate content pages matching the naming convention values to ensure the descriptions are displayed correctly.
