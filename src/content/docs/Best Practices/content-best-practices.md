# Eyebrow

The eyebrow is a short phrase or label that appears _above_ the main heading. It's a subtle but powerful tool.
### Use Cases

- **Categorization:** Its most common use is to label content, indicating that it belongs to a specific category, series, or topic. For example, an article on a tech blog might have "PRODUCTIVITY" as its eyebrow.        
- **Context for Creative Headlines:** It frees the main heading to be more engaging, creative, or mysterious by providing the necessary context. An eyebrow like "CONTENT STRATEGY" above the headline "The Silent Echo That Sells Millions" makes the headline immediately understandable.        
- **Series Identification:** It's perfect for indicating that a piece of content is part of a sequence, such as "PART 3 OF 4."        
- **Navigation:** In some cases, an eyebrow can be a clickable link that takes the user to an archive page with all content from that category.        
### Best Practices

- **Secondary Hierarchy:** The eyebrow is visually subordinate to the main heading. It should be smaller, lighter in weight, and possibly a different color to avoid competing for attention.        
- **Do Not Include Critical Information:** Users may skip the eyebrow in their initial scan. The main heading should be understandable on its own.        
- **Be Concise:** Eyebrows should be short and to the point.        
- **Uppercase is Common:** Uppercasing the text is a common convention that signals it's a label or metadata.

# Heading 

Headings(H1, H2, H3, etc.) are the most important elements for structuring and organizing a web page. They provide a clear visual hierarchy and are crucial for both SEO and accessibility.

### Use Cases

- H1 (The Main Heading):** Every page should have one, and only one, `H1` tag. It's the title of the page and should clearly and concisely describe the primary topic. For a blog post, this is the article's title. For a product page, it's the product's name.        
- **H2 (Major Section Headings):** H2s divide the page into its main sections. A user should be able to scan just the H2s on a page to get a sense of its overall structure and what topics are covered.        
- **H3 and Lower (Sub-Sections):** These headings are used to further break down the content within an `H2` section. Think of them as sub-points in a paper outline.        
###  Best Practices:

- **Hierarchical Order:** Headings must be used in a logical, hierarchical order. You should never skip a level (e.g., going directly from an `H1` to an `H3`). This is critical for screen readers, which rely on this structure for navigation.        
- **Descriptive and Concise:** Headings should be clear and descriptive of the content that follows. This helps users quickly find the information they are looking for and is a key factor for SEO.        
- **Keyword-Rich:** Include relevant keywords in your headings to improve search engine rankings.        
- **Avoid Overuse:** Don't use headings just to make text bigger. Use them to create a semantic outline of the content.

# Subheading

A subheading is a line of text that appears directly under the main heading. It provides a brief summary or expansion of the main headline, adding more detail or a benefit statement.
### Use Cases   

- **Clarification:** Subheadings are great for clarifying an ambiguous or clever headline.        
- **Summarizing the Main Idea:** They can quickly give the reader a more detailed understanding of what the page or article is about, encouraging them to continue reading.	
- **Benefit-Oriented Statements:** In a marketing context, a subheading can highlight the key benefit the user will get from reading the content or using a product.        
### Best Practices

- **Follows the Main Heading:** Subheadings are visually and logically connected to the `H1`.
- **Visually Distinct:** They should be styled differently from the main heading and the body content, typically with a smaller font size than the `H1` but a larger or bolder font than the regular content text.        
- **Keep it Short:** A subheading should be a few lines at most.

# Content Text

Content text is the main body of your website's information. It's where you deliver the value, details, and message to your audience.
### Use Cases

- **Primary Information Delivery:** The content text provides the detailed information that was promised by the headings and subheadings.        
- **Explaining Concepts:** This is where you explain complex ideas, provide instructions, and tell your story. 
### Best Practices

- **Readability:** Use a legible font, an appropriate font size (typically 16px or larger on desktop), and a good line height to ensure the text is easy to read.        
- **Scannable:** Break up long paragraphs into smaller chunks. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and bold text to highlight key points.        
- **White Space:** Generous white space around paragraphs and sections prevents visual fatigue and makes the content more inviting.        
- **Logical Flow:** Ensure the content text flows logically from one section to the next, building on the ideas presented in the headings.        
- **Accessibility:** Choose high-contrast colors for your text and background to ensure it is readable for users with low vision.
