The Ecommerce Group Header and Footer component adds a unique header and footer to a product list page. It automatically links to the content on the page with the specific ID configured at the Group level.

### Development Notes
- The header and footer content is pulled from the `Ecommerce Group Header` and `Ecommerce Group Footer` fields at the Group level.
- The header and footer are displayed on the product list page associated with the group.
