The Custom Paragraph is an Ignite element that allows developers to add a fully customized layout to their implementation. Because of its flexibility, it should only be used when project requirements can't be met with other, more specific Ignite layout components.

### Development Notes

The custom template should be created by a developer and added to your project. It can include any HTML structure and CSS styles you need at :`/Files/Templates/Designs/Swift-v2/CustomParagraph/template.cshtml`.
