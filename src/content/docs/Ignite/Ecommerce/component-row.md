The **Component Row** is an Ignite element designed to structure content within specific e-commerce contexts, such as Product Lists or Product Detail pages. It allows for the organization of various components in a row format, enhancing the visual layout and user experience on your e-commerce site.

# Features
- **Columns**: You can set the number of columns from **1** to **3**.
- **Gap**: Controls the spacing (gutter) between column elements (**None / Small / Default / Large / X-Large**)
- **Horizontal Padding**: This feature adds horizontal padding to the row, which is particularly useful for design elements like product cards.
